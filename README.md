# Self-Driving Car Project

This project is a self-driving car simulation built using deep learning. It uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The entry point for the project is `main.js`. The project also requires **Node.js** for managing dependencies.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of a self-driving car.
- Uses deep learning algorithms for decision-making and navigation.
- Simple UI for demonstration purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** (Node Package Manager, comes with Node.js)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Harshith150/Car-Game.git
    cd Car-Game
    ```

2. **Install required node modules**:
    Since the `node_modules` directory is not included in the repo, you need to install the dependencies manually:
    ```bash
